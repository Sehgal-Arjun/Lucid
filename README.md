## 📚 Dataset & 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **user-generated**. Each user can create a daily journal entry through a calendar-style interface. Every entry includes:
- A text-based journal reflecting their mood for the day
- A set of selected **emotion characters** inspired by *Inside Out* (e.g., Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust)

To test and demo the application, we will also include a **sample dataset** generated manually and via a small Python script. This includes:
- 10 test users
- 100+ journal entries spanning 30 days
- A predefined set of 5 mood characters

No external real-world datasets were used due to the personalized nature of the application.
